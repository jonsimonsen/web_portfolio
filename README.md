# web_portfolio
Project for building a portfolio for developed web sites

# TODO-list
-Publish web design from my last assignment. Because it's related to a previous employer, I feel like I need to go through it to remove potentially sensitive information (especially pictures) and replace them with meaningful alternatives. I should also make sure that the version I publish is working in most browsers, since there are some issues regarding older browsers. I'm also using a file reading function that needs to be rewritten, since most browsers have stopped supporting it (at least without advanced tweaking of the settings).
-If I'm unable to produce a satisfactory result shortly, I should upload image files of the various web sites instead of the source code.

# v0.1:
